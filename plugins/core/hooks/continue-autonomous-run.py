"""
Stop hook that drives `core:execute-implement-a-project-autonomously`.

When `.gro/run.json` marks an autonomous run as active for this session, the
hook counts unchecked work items in the plan's `plan.md`. Work left means the
turn is blocked and the model is handed the next item; no work left means the
hook stays silent and the session ends on its own.

`plan.md` is the single source of truth for progress: milestone issue boxes,
milestone verification gates, and the wrap-up checklist all live there, in the
order they must be worked. Document order is execution order.

The continuation condition is a pure function of files on disk. The model
cannot talk its way past it -- it can only tick a checkbox, which
`core:execute-implement-a-project` permits only after the work is verified.
