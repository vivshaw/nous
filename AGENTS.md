# AGENTS.md

Working guide for `gro`, viv shaw's Claude Code plugin marketplace.

## What this repo is

A curated marketplace of 5 plugins, mostly forked-and-evolved from [obra/superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) (MIT) and [ed3dai/ed3d-plugins](https://github.com/ed3dai/ed3d-plugins) (CC BY-SA 4.0).

Plugins included:

| plugin | contents |
|---|---|
| `core` | brainstorm → plan → implement → review, **all** subagent definitions, research + prose skills |
| `meta`  | skills for authoring plugins, skills, agents, marketplaces |
| `style` | coding standards + language-specific patterns |
| `extra` | hooks that enforce automatic good habits |
| `research` | skills to help with research and presenting findings |

## Structure

- **`core` is home to all agents.** Every subagent definition lives in `plugins/core/agents/`, generic or workflow-bound. The one exception is `meta:project-context-librarian`, which is driven by `meta:maintaining-project-context` and lives with it.
- **`core` is also home to the workflow itself** (brainstorm → plan → implement → review), the skills that dispatch agents, and the prose skills.
- **`meta` is home to all skills about working with skills/agents/plugins** (the self-referential layer).
- **`style` is home to all skills about coding guidelines**, including for specific languages or frameworks.
- **`research` is home to skills for research** — at the moment, data visualization.
- **`extra` is home to hooks** that enforce good habits automatically. Hooks belonging to a specific workflow live with that workflow instead — `core`'s `reminder-use-generic-agents.sh`, `reminder-use-skills.sh`, and `continue-autonomous-run.py` are in `plugins/core/hooks/`.

## Reference conventions

**Always use `<plugin>:<identifier>` form** when referring to a skill or agent, even within the same plugin. Examples:

- `` `core:researcher-codebase` `` ✓
- `` `researcher-codebase` `` ✗ (bare, even from inside core)
- `Dispatch core:researcher-internet with...` ✓
- `Dispatch researcher-internet with...` ✗

Applies to:
- Backticked references
- Bare prose mentions
- `subagent_type` dispatch parameters
- READMEs, comments, hook script output, everything

**Explicit exceptions** (do NOT prefix):
- Frontmatter `name:` declarations (a skill or agent declaring itself)
- File paths like `agents/critic-code-reviewer.md` or `<skill>/SKILL.md`
- URLs

## Licensing

The whole marketplace is **CC BY-SA 4.0**. Whenever skills or plugins are forked in, ensure that you are following their licenses appropriately, and preserve those licenses. Current licenses to be aware of:

- **CC BY-SA 4.0 content from ed3dai/ed3d-plugins** → `LICENSE.ed3d-plugins` in the plugin root
- **MIT content from obra/superpowers** → `LICENSE.superpowers` in the plugin root
- **vivshaw-original content** → top-level `LICENSE`
- **The Inter typeface bundled in `research`** (SIL OFL 1.1) → `OFL.txt` beside the font files it covers.

Every plugin's `README.md` must include a `## credits` section that names upstream sources and points at the per-plugin `LICENSE.*` files.

## Required tooling

Use gro to develop gro! The `meta` plugin contains the skills you need to work effectively in this repo.

### Repo tooling

`tools/` holds scripts that maintain the repo rather than ship in a plugin.

**Need a browser? Drive Playwright directly, at will:** screenshot a page, click through a state, measure a layout. It launches its own browser with a throwaway profile and cannot attach to a running one. Never launch a browser binary found on the machine. On macOS, running an installed browser's executable while it is already open hands your command line to the *live* instance instead of starting a new one, which can break your user's browser session.

### Python toolchain

The Python hook scripts and tools have a Nix & uv toolchain wired up at the repo root. See [docs/CONTRIBUTING.md](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full setup and command reference. After modifying either, run `uv run pytest` before committing.

## Adding things

### A new skill

1. Use the `meta:writing-skills` skill.
2. Set `user-invocable: false` unless you explicitly want `/<plugin>:<skill-name>` as a slash command
3. Cross-reference other skills/agents using the `<plugin>:<name>` form
4. Update the plugin's `README.md` "what's inside" section

### A new agent

Use the `meta:creating-an-agent` skill to create the agent. Agents go in `plugins/core/agents/<agent-name>.md`.

### A new plugin

Only create one if it's thematically distinct from the existing 5. then:

1. Choose a short, conceptually apt name (the older plugins use Greek philosophy terms; newer ones favor plain English)
2. Use the `meta:creating-a-plugin` skill
3. Add a bullet to the top-level `README.md` "currently in stock" list
4. Set up `LICENSE.*` files for any forked content

## Committing, Versioning, Releasing

- Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/). Always include the scope: `feat(core): ...`, `chore(docs): ...`. Check `git log` for the scopes already in use.
- Keep `CHANGELOG.md` up to date, following [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) for what goes in it. Prefix every entry with the plugin it touches — `- **core:** ...` — and use `- **repo:** ...` for changes outside the plugins.
- Use [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org). All five plugins and the marketplace share one version and move together, so a breaking change anywhere bumps everything. Keep `plugins/*/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`, and the release tag in sync. `meta:maintaining-a-marketplace` has the release checklist.
